# Prudential_LifeIns
In this repository I will undertake three tasks:
1) Basic data analysis of prudential data set
2) Analysis of economic implications for the weighted kappa loss function, and distribution of risk categories
3) A few quick and dirty machine learning attempts to predict risk categories
