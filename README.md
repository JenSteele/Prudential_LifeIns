## An analysis of the Kaggle 'Prudential Life Insurance' challenge (post-deadline)

In this repository I will undertake two main tasks: 

1) Basic data analysis of prudential data set, including some basic cleaning and sorting of the dataset.

2) Analysis of economic implications for the weighted kappa loss function, and distribution of risk categories, with a look at the effect on expected loss due to mislabelling with various risk distributions.
